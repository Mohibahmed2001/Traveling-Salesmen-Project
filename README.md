So some of the biggest takeaways I had for this project was how efficient nearest neighbor is as well as how close it gets to the most optimal 
difference majority of the time. In a situation where you are in a time crunch, I believe nearest neighbor is a good outcome to pick. The only
big issue I have seen is that it relies heavily on the starting node which is very essential to how optimal the tour will end up becoming. As well 
as it doesnâ€™t focus on global optimization. While what I noticed for greedyTSP is that it is overall efficient, but it is heavily reliant on the 
order that edges are considered resulting in its approximation in the way I implemented it to be not as close to the optimal solution as nearest neighbor
was. As well as my time efficiency was much slower. The coolest thing I learned about the TSP was how people attempted to code it optimally. As well as 
how quickly the time required becomes exponential such as for China in which it required 5 full days to find the optimal solution. Which shows how quicky
the computing can go from 1000 to 70000. It also illustrates issue of how we are limited in bigger data structures becomes when a problem become exponential 
to solve it becomes a NP problem. Overall I really enjoyed the project it help teached me a lot about graph algorithms.
